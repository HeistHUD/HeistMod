## Development Branch
Welcome to the dev branch, if you'd like to help me test out new stuff this is the version to try.
Beware that due to this being in development, crashes or bugs are very likely. If you encounter any feel free to open an issue about it.

### What will be in version 1.2
- Added joining player panels
- Added better fade-in animation for loading screens
- Added Chinese localization made by CoolLKK 
- Fixed a crash related to the loading screens and the BeardLib-Editor
